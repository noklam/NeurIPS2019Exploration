This is an app for exploring the papers of NeuRIPS 2019. With only 1 month to go, it is impossible to read all the papers. I found that the official site is not very helpful for exploration, so I build this mini-app for better exploration.


# Tools
* Heroku (For deployment)
* streamlit (the app)
* pandas, request and beautifulsoup4 for parsing the information
* https://my.freenom.com/ (for the free domain name of the site)
* Google Universal Sentence Encoder for similiarity score


# Resource:
To deploy a streamlit app with Heroku, I found this blog post is very useful for a newbie to Heroku & streamlit:
