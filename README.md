# NeuRIPS2019 App
This is a simple app for exploring the papers of NeuRIPS 2019. As I found that there are way too many papers and the official site did not provide any categorization, so I build this app for better exploration.

# Tools
* Heroku (For deployment)
* streamlit (the app)
* pandas, request and beautifulsoup4 for parsing the information
